## Installation Process 
Full installation instructions can be found here but assumes the user is on Windows 7: https://veins.car2x.org/tutorial/. These instructions assume Ubuntu 22.04.1

Veins also requires:
-	SUMO 1.8.0
-	OMNeT++ 6.0 
These versions were chosen for our specific setup, see the website for all compatible versions of SUMO and OMNeT++. 

### Prerequisites
For building on Ubuntu, the following packages may be required.
Run: 
`sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc g++ bison flex perl tcl-dev tk-dev blt libxml2-dev zlib1g-dev default-jre doxygen graphviz libwebkitgtk-1.0-0 openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev libpcap-dev autoconf automake libtool libproj-dev libgdal1-dev libfox-1.6-dev libgdal-dev libxerces-c-dev qt4-dev-tools`


#### Libwebkitgtk-1.0-0 Issue
If Libwebkitgtk-1.0-0 causes an error, do the following: 
- Add the following to `/etc/apt/sources.list`: 
  - `deb [trusted=yes] http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu bionic main universe`
- Run `sudo apt-get update`
- Run `sudo apt-get install libwebkitgtk-1.0-0` 

#### Libgdal1-dev Issue
If Libgdal1-dev causes an error, it can be ignored. 

### Install SUMO
Download the SUMO 1.8.0 binaries at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/sumo/files/sumo/version%201.8.0/

Unpack in desired location as: `<path_to_location>\sumo-1.8.0`

You should find the executable: `<path_to_location>\sumo-1.8.0\bin\sumo.exe`

Build SUMO following these instructions: https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing/index.html

### Install OMNeT++
Download the Linux distribution here: https://omnetpp.org/download/old
Unpack to: `<path_to_location>/omnetpp-6.0`

*Make sure the folder name contains no spaces* 

To build, run the following: 
-	`./configure`
-	`make`

You should find: `<path_to_location>/omnetpp-6.0/bin/omnetpp`

Run: 
-	`source setenv `
-	`omnetpp`

to launch the OMNeT++ IDE. Choose `<path_to_location>\omnetpp-6.0\samples\<optional_sub_folder>` as your workspace when prompted 

### Install Veins
Download Veins 5.2: https://veins.car2x.org/download/

Unpack it to: `<path_to_location>\veins-5.2`

In the OMNeT++ IDE, import the Veins project as follows:
-	Click `File > Import > General: Existing Projects into Workspace`
-	Select the `veins-5.2` directory 
-	Select `Project > Build All` to build

## Launching Veins

Run a scenario under `examples` (eg; *SingleAttackerV2VScenario.ned*) by right-clicking on a .ned file and selecting `Run As > OMNeT++ Simulation`. This will launch a Qtenv window. Click the green play button in the top left corner to run the scenario. After the initial setup, the following steps can be used each time Veins/OMNeT++ needs to be launched. 

Run: `export PATH=$PATH:<path_to_sumo>/sumo-1.8.0/bin`
-	This can be permanently set in the .profile 

Run: `<path_to_veins>/veins-5.2/bin/veins_launchd -vv -c <path_to_sumo>/sumo-1.8.0/bin/sumo.exe`

In the OMNeT++ IDE, right-click: `veins-5.2/examples/veins/omnetpp.ini`

And `Run As > OMNeT++ simulation`. 

**Note: If the Veins project is hiding, click `Window > Show View > Project Explorer`. You should see a veins folder and find the .ini file.**
