# PriorityV2VAttack

A single attacker performs DoS with high priority messages and floods the network. Attack originates from a malicious vehicle actor. Please see the `SingleAttackerV2V` scenario's README for more information. 

`.appl.dataUserPriority` is modified in the .ini file to allow an `attacker` to send higher priority messages than 'normal' traffic. All other parameters are the same as the `SingleAttackerV2V` scenario.
